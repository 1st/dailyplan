Daily Plan
=========

Daily Plan - Django application designed to help you collect tasks and to be focused on the right way


Idea
=========

Based on my experience I deside to collect my tasks in this way.

 - my personal lists. You can create any number of lists (Home and family, Work, Travel, Ideas, etc) + "Uncategorized" list
 - magic lists (important, near future, completed)
 - show all important tasks ordered by myself. Tasks devided by lines "Today", "Tomorrow" and "Soon"
 - easy to use drag-and-drop interface (set ordering and move task between lists)
 - task consist of title and description + list of subtasks. You can attach any file (image or document) or link to website and remember all details
 - add comments to task. When task status changes - you see new auto-comment about this change


Contribution
=========

You can help me implement this idea. To do this, you need to know how work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you have exprience with Python and Django - this is a big plus. Just clone repo and make changes. And after all - publish your changes as push request. If all right - your changes will be added as soon as possible.

Thank you for interest to my project.
